Modify 2D-FFT( Fast Fourier Transform) and implemented by 4 different  palatalization techniques  and  models.
Include SPMD( single program, multiple data) model and Task and Data Parallel model with parallel code.
(a) Implement the 2D convolution using SPMD model and use MPI send and receive operations. 
(b) Implement 2D convolution using SPMD model but use MPI collective communication functions wherever possible.
(c) Implement 2D convolution model using SPMD model using hybrid programming with MPIopenMP.
(d) Implement 2D convolution model using a Task and Data Parallel Model. 
And last, compare each executed time with different number of processer (1, 2, 4 and 8). Then, compare all models executed time with 8 processer
